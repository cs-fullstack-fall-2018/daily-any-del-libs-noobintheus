# Daily question on using 3rd party dev libraries

This week we used a 3rd party library called Bootstrap, and will be using others in the future. Bootstrap provides code that you can pull into your code and use.

Thinking out using 3rd party libraies like Bootstrap and jQuery, which of the following statements is true and the main reason why a developer would use a JavaScript library??

A. 3rd party libraries always ensure quality code that does not harbor any security risks.

B. 3rd party libraries are always easier to learn than JavaScript.

C. 3rd party libraries can be used to develop content and applications much faster than writing it all from scratch.

D. 3rd party libraries provide platform-independent code that will behave identically in any browser.
